Schemas
=======

The schemas ORM2Core.xsd and ORM2Root.xsd are direct copies from the NORMA tool.
Development of the norma_loader.py module was based upon an analysis of their contents.
The schemas are included here for two reasons:

# Reference
# As a point of comparison in case the file format for NORMA is updated

The ReducedORMSchema.xsd file is a "scratch" file that was used to determine the 
parts of the the other two NORMA schemas that were needed for norma_loader.py.
