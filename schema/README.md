Schemas
=======

The schemas ORM2Core.xsd and ORM2Root.xsd are direct copies from the NORMA tool.
Development of the norma_loader.py module was based upon an analysis of their contents.
The schemas are included here for two reasons:

* Reference
* As a point of comparison in case the file format for NORMA is updated

Matt Curland (author of NORMA) provided me with the file 
DerivationRulesInNORMA.docx, which provides some examples and context on the
use of join paths in NORMA.  I used that document as a supplement to understand
the <JoinRule> structure in .orm files.
